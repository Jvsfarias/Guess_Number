# Guess_Number
That's my "first" project using JavaScript.... I got the HTML and CSS from a course that i'am watching, and i did by my own all JavaScript part.

Rules: You have 20 attempts to guess which aleatory number was generated, the number are between 1 and 20. You highscore are automatically saved and you can trie as many time as you want! Hope you like it <3

Can you see the result here:
